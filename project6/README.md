#Android Conversion

This assignment asks you to migrate your previous Java assignment to the version of Android application. Development of Android application is within a limited set of Java capabilities, e.g., Java 2D Graphics is only partially supported for Android environment. The conversion needs some Android specifics which may be understood by watching posted video script.

Use Android Studio to realize the task. The process flow of the Android operating environment is simple, but is different from the pure Java Swing in that the static GUI parts are shifted to text-level XML definition (and thus no need of coding). The mission to achieve this migration is not easy, especially for those who keep skipping my lectures on some key hints for Android application development. Start as early as possible -- this work may not be completed within one weekend. The requirement of the assignment is:

1. Android Studio 1.4.1 (newest stable)
2. API 23: Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) Build Tools Version 23.0.2
3. AVD as Nexus 5 API 23 X86 emulator

I will use the above environment to test and grade your work. Many examples to realize parts of this application are available on the Web. Similar, complicated implementations are found too, but this assignment is realized at most 250 lines (mine is 235 with comment lines). Use our discussion board to share your Q/As (email to me won't work).
